# hello-world
starter test project

This is a readme file for a hello world iniciation *program*.
Now the readme file is directly written as a Markdown file, which is **pretty** cool.

Now let's solidify the learning here: new branch called new-readme-edits (yes, very original).
That should do it. Once the file is modified, we have to commit the changes (id. to a save for a local file).
Then, we'll have to do a pull request that will have to be accepted before being able to merge the changes committed.
